Link text rule
1. Avoid printing full url to web page
2. Avoid "links to" phrase
3. Keep link text short. Exact topic not sentence
4. Avoid "clikc here"
5. No email on webpage to avoid spider


Image:
1. Provide title
2. Add height and width, even though they can be overriden by CSS
   or not required for now. Why???
   Cumulative Layout Shift -> The browser shifting the Layout
   because of something else that happened somewhere else
   Providing width and height will tell the browser beforehand
   to assign that much space 
3. set loading="lazy" to improve performance --> if the Image
is below the fold, it won't load until it is scrolled to

Layout:
1. Anything below which we can't see is called fold
usage: anything below the fold, scroll to see

Figure and figcaption:
figcaption should either be first or  last element inside figure
